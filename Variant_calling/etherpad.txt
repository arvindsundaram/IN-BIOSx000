The course machines are named: ibv-course01.hpc.uio.no

## IGV VIA SSH FOR UNIX LAPTOPS (LINUX & MAC OSX)
When starting IGV you can use the ThinLink but there are some problems with dialog boxes . An alternative is to login directly via ssh and then start up IGV. For this to work you need to used the -X option
ssh -X username@ibv-course01.hpc.uio.no
Then once you are logged in, you start IGV using:
/share/inf-biox121/IGV_2.3.81/igv.sh
    
    
## READING THE HELPFUL MANUAL
