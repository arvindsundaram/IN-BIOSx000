Please install Anaconda on your laptop before Monday (better: before Friday)
https://www.continuum.io/ 
Choose 'Download Anaconda'
Choose Python 3.5 version GRAPHICAL INSTALLER

Then see if you can start a Jupyter notebook, either from the 'Launcher' coming with Anaconda, or by opening a terminal window and typing

jupyter notebook

You will also need to install some python packages with

pip install pysam graphviz biopython

Finally, if you want to run quast, you have to temporarliy change the name of the
/share/inf-biox121/home/username/anaconda3 folder, e.g.

    cd
    mv anaconda3 anaconda3_bak


Resources for those not having too much biology background
(I have not selected which ones are most relevant):
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/?term=molecular%20biology
(and maybe http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143764/)


Copy data over to your harddisk
on your local machine, 'cd' to an appropriate folder
rsync -av username@ username@ibv-course0#.hpc.uio.no:/share/inf-biox121/home/username/path/to/file .
Replace '#' with correct number (type 'hostname' on the course server)
This should ask for you password and download the file

To load config file in the remote terminal:
    source ~/.bashrc
Or to make it permanent:w
    echo "source ~/.bashrc" >> .bash_profile

De Bruijn question: Aren't the algorithm supposed to divide the kmers into one "left" and "right" part of the KMER and iff the right matches one of the left sides to any of the others kmers you make a link. Is this correct? Hmmm.... I think the edges (links) represent a k-1 length overlap, so this covers what you say, doesn't it? Let me rephrase. I think you should look up the formal definition, which should be unambiguous. Try Pevzner PA, Tang H, Waterman MS. 2001. An Eulerian path approach to DNA fragment assembly. PNAS 98:9748–53

Each group:
one per person, divide amongst you:    
Spades Illumina only 
Spades Illumina + pacbio
Spades Illumina + MinION 
Divide amongst you two more assemblies
Canu with PacBio
Canu with MinION
NOT quiver


Check your job:
    
    top -u username
    
    (use 'q' to get out of top)
    Expect to see 'hammer' for SPADES and 'meryl' for canu (at least in the beginning)

Using screen
https://wiki.uio.no/projects/clsi/index.php/Tip:using_screen

Another way to use the server is not through the web browser, but through the terminal
ssh -X username@ibv-course0#.hpc.uio.no where # is the number you see when you type 
If not on UiO wifi, you'll have to use a VPN connection to UiO before this works

QUAST
workaround to get it working:
    
    temporarliy change the name of the /share/inf-biox121/home/username/anaconda3 folder, e.g.
    cd
    mv anaconda3 anaconda3.bak

quast.py -t 2 -o quast_out \

-l "velvet_PE+MP, SPADES_PE+MP"
