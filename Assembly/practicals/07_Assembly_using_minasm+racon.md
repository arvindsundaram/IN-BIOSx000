Assembly using miniasm+racon
================================

This [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/14/2103/1742895/Minimap-and-miniasm-fast-mapping-and-de-novo)
described a fast approach for assembling and correcting PacBio and MinION data.
This [paper](jajakumar!!!!) compared several long read assemblers, and while
they found 'canu' to be the best, miniasm+racon was not far behind, and performed
significantly faster.

The principle is:

* using `minimap` for fast all-against-all overlap of raw reads
* using `miniasm`, this "simply concatenates pieces of read sequences to
generate the final sequences. Thus the per-base error rate is similar to the
raw input reads."
* mapping the raw reads back to the assembly using `minimap` again
* using `racon` ('rapid consensus') for consensus calling

They also recommend running `racon` twice, we will settle for once.

* perform the `racon` step at least twice

## Running `miniasm` and `racon` on MinION data

### All-against-all overlap with `minimap`

First, ensure that you are in the `assembly` directory. Create a new directory
created `miniasm` and inside of that one, a directory called `minion`.
Go inside the `minion` directory.

Note how the reads are used twice here, as we map the reads against themselves:

```
minimap -Sw5 -L100 -m0 \
-t 3 \
/share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/MAP006-1_2D_pass.fastq \
/share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/MAP006-1_2D_pass.fastq \
| gzip -1 >racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.paf.gz
```
<!---
Took 1 minute
-->

The output is in the so-called [PAF (Pairwise mApping) Format]
(https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md), and is compressed
'on the fly'.


### Assembly with `miniasm`

`miniasm` takes the `paf` file and produces an assembly
in [GFA (Graphical Fragment Assembly)](https://github.com/pmelsted/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA-spec.md) format.

```
miniasm -f /share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/MAP006-1_2D_pass.fastq \
racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.paf.gz \
>racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.gfa
```
<!---
fast
-->

Since we have only one sequence in the `GFA` file (at least for this assembly),
we can use a simple set of unix commands to turn it into a `fasta` file:

```
head -n 1 racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.gfa | awk '{print ">"$2; print $3}' > racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.raw_assembly.fasta
```

### Correction with `racon`

We first use `minimap` again, this time with the original reads mapped against
the 'raw' assembly:

```
minimap racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.raw_assembly.fasta \
/share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/MAP006-1_2D_pass.fastq \
>racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.raw_assembly.reads_mapped.paf
```

`racon` is basically run as `racon -t num_threads reads.fastq mapped_reads.paf assembly.fasta consensus.fasta`:

```
racon -t 2 \
/share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/MAP006-1_2D_pass.fastq \
racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.raw_assembly.reads_mapped.paf \
racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.raw_assembly.fasta \
racon_MAP006-1_2D_1.racon1.fasta
```

This will take some time.

Time" 10 minutes

### Correction with `racon`, round 2

As mentioned in the paper, for the best results, we could run `racon` again.
We will not do that here, but if we were, this would be how.

Run the mapping with `minimap` and the correction with `racon` again, but now
with the results of the first round of correction.

That is:
* for minimap: map the reads to the racon1 assembly fasta file
* for racon: use the racon1 fasta file as the assembly file, and the reads
that mapped to racon1 as the mapped reads.

Please be careful when naming files!

## Running `miniasm` and `racon` on PacBio data

Use *all* available reads from the P6C4 run, i.e. :

```
/share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/m141013_011508_sherri_c100709962550000001823135904221533_s1_p0.filtered_subreads.fastq
```

Do this in a sister directory of the previous directory, name this one `pacbio`.

The commands are the same as for the MinION data. Again, please be careful when
naming files!
