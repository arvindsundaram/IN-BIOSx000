Comparing assemblies to the reference
=====================================

The Quast program can be used to generate similar metrics as the 
assemblathon_stat.pl script, plus some more and some visualisations.

`Quast` options:

* `-o`: name of output folder
* `-R`: Reference genome
* `-G`: File with positions of genes in the reference (see manual)
* `-T`: number of threads (cpu's) to use
* `sequence.fasta`: one or more files with assembled sequences
* `-l`:  comma-separated list of names for the assemblies, e.g. `"assembly 1, 
assembly 2"` (in the same order as the sequence files) 
* `--scaffolds`: input sequences are scaffolds, not contigs. They will be split 
at 10 N's or more to analyse contigs ('broken' assembly) 
* `--est-ref-size`:  estimated reference genome size (when genome not provided) 
* `--gene-finding`: apply `GenemarkS` for gene finding

See the manual for information on the output of Quast:

<!--
NOTE: on the course server, you can't run `quast` if anaconda is in your PATH. To temporarily remove anaconda, run

```
$ cd
$ mv anaconda3 anaconda3_bak
```

Now log out and back in again.

Other programs/scripts need anaconda, so you should name the folder back to `anaconda3` when you want to use them again and log out and back in again. Sorry for the confusion.

### Running Quast

Go to the `assembly` folder, make a folder called `quast` and move into it. 
Run this command (this is for one assembly, for examining more, add the assembly
fasta files).

Run this on the velvet paired end and mate pair assembly. Choose a sensible
output file name, and remember to type in the right path to the assembly.

```
quast.py -t 3 \
-o OUT_FOLDER_NAME \
-R /share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/NC_000913_K12_MG1655.fasta \
-G /share/inf-biox121/data/assembly/e.coli_genes.gff \
../path/to/velvet_pe_mp \
-l "Velvet PE+MP"
```

Note that the `--scaffold` option is not used here for simplification. Also, 
if there are multiple assemblies being compared, make sure you name the 
assemblies (`-l`) in the same order as you give them to quast!

### Quast output
Quast will produce a html report file `report.html`. Use the file browser 
(Places) to find the file in the Explorer, and double-click on it. It will
open the file in your browser. Hover over the row names to get a description. 
Also have a look  at the 'Extended report'.

Alternatively, have a look at the report.pdf file (it has a few more plots).
