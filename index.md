## Introduction

This is the webpage for the fall 2018 edition of the credited courses [**IN-BIOS5000**](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS5000) (master level) and [**IN-BIOS9000**](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS9000) (Ph.D. level) offered by the Department of Informatics and the Department of Biosciences at the University of Oslo (UiO) and funded by [**NORBIS**](https://norbis.w.uib.no/activities/courses/genome-sequencing-technologies-assembly-variant-calling-and-statistical-genomics).

This course consists of two weeks, of
lectures and practicals, and a final take-home exam, plus a written exam on the course material and the reading material.

## Schedule
Course days are usually from 9:15 to 17:00 (teachers may stay longer if
requested), some lectures, mostly hands-on exercises. All materials for lectures and practicals will be linked from the schedule below.

The schedule will appear here early in August and will link to the webpages with the material taught (these links are added as the course progresses).

Written exam will take place on Nov 30 at 1430 hrs (2 hour exam) in [Store fysiske lesesal Fysikkbygningen](http://www.google.com/maps/preview?t=h&f=q&q=59.937924,10.718729+(Fysikkbygningen)&z=16)

## Requirements

* We recommend that participants should have a basic understanding of molecular biology as provided by an introductory course in bioinformatics, molecular biology, or genetics.

* No formal background in computer science is required, however, students must have a basic understanding of the unix shell. Students should take an introductory unix course beforehand if they do not have these skills.


## Computers/laptops, internet access, and UiO user account
All students must bring a laptop with either a Windows (Windows 7 or more recent), Unix/Linux, or OS X (i.e. an Apple computer) operating system.

* The computer should not be more than 2-3 years old
* It should be possible to connect the computer to the UiO wireless network
* You must have modern internet browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ...)
* You must have a valid UiO user account and must be able to log onto a computer on the UiO network
  * If you are unsure if you have a UiO user account and a valid password, you should try to log in using kiosk.uio.no as described [here](http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/network/home-and-away/kiosk/index.html). If you are unable to log in, try the hints you find [here](http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/network/home-and-away/kiosk/programkiosk/index.html).
  * Instructions (in Norwegian) about how to find your user name and get a new password can be found [here](http://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/brukernavn-passord/ikke-passord.html).
* We advise to bring an external mouse, and do not rely on touchpad/trackpad only

If you are struggling with anything of the above, in particular if you have forgotten your UiO user name/password or you do not have one, you must contact the course coordinator (see contact details on this page) as soon as possible, and at least one week before the start of the course.

## Curriculum and suggested reading
The curriculum consists of a set of scientific articles. The exam will
contain questions on the material presented in these papers on the material covered during the course. Specific details of the curriculum, and a list of further suggested papers, can be found [here](Curriculum).

## Exam [Link to exam information at UiO](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS5000/h18/eksamen/index.html)

The exam for this course will be:

-   a written exam on the course and curriculum, time and place
    to be announced
-   an *individual*, home exam
    combined with an oral examination of the home exam time, and place
    to be announced. Students will present their work to two-three teachers,
    followed by some questioning (20-30 minutes in total). This home exam will
    be handed out to all participants during the last course day.


**NOTE** Both exams have to be passed to earn study credits.

**NOTE** 80% attendance is required to take the final exam.
